# curl2step
A repository that aims to bring cURL to the OpenStep Operating system 

This repo has been created to document the work of creating a (somewhat) modern version of cURL on the OpenStep operating system. This has been created buy using Grok 3 AI to work through the process of porting cURL to the OpenStep operating system. Below will be the AI Created framework to do this. 

For anyone interested in working on this, please jump in and do your thing. I am merely here to start the process.

Key Points
It seems likely that implementing modern Curl on OpenStep 4.2 is feasible by compiling an early version, such as curl 5.0 from 1998, with its dependency SSLeay.

Research suggests that OpenStep 4.2, with its GCC 2.7.2.1 compiler, can support compiling C-based tools like Curl and SSLeay, given their contemporary release timelines.

The evidence leans toward needing to port SSLeay for HTTPS support, which may require additional effort due to limited documentation for vintage systems.

System Compatibility
OpenStep 4.2, released in 1996, runs on NeXT computers (680x0), SUN SPARC, and Intel 486 machines, with RAM ranging from 32MB to 128MB. These systems have limited resources, so optimizing compilation for size and performance is crucial. Curl, being a lightweight command-line tool, should fit within these constraints, especially an early version like 5.0.
Dependencies and Porting
Curl 5.0 requires SSLeay for HTTPS support, a C library from the mid-90s. Given OpenStep's Unix-based nature and available C compiler, porting SSLeay seems possible, though it may need manual configuration. Other dependencies, like standard C libraries, are likely already present on OpenStep.
Implementation Steps
To implement Curl:
Download curl 5.0 source code from historical archives, such as the Wayback Machine.

Download and compile SSLeay, ensuring compatibility with OpenStep's compiler.

Compile Curl, linking against SSLeay, and install the binaries.

Test on target systems or emulators like Previous to ensure functionality.

Survey Note: Detailed Implementation of Curl on OpenStep 4.2
This survey note provides a comprehensive analysis of implementing modern Curl on NextStep/OpenStep operating systems, specifically OpenStep 4.2, considering the system's vintage nature and limited resources. The focus is on compiling an early version of Curl, such as curl 5.0 from 1998, along with its dependencies, to ensure compatibility with NeXT computers, SUN SPARC servers, and Intel 486 machines, as well as emulators like Previous.
Background and Context
OpenStep 4.2, released in 1996, is an object-oriented API specification developed by NeXT, based on a Unix operating system with the Mach kernel and BSD components (OpenStep - Wikipedia). It supports multiple architectures, including Motorola 680x0, SPARC, and x86, making it suitable for the specified hardware. The systems have limited resources, with CPUs like 68040 and RAM ranging from 32MB to 128MB, necessitating optimized compilation for performance and memory usage.
Curl, a command-line tool and library for transferring data with URLs, was first released in 1996 as HttpGet, renamed to urlget, and then to curl by March 20, 1998, with version 4.0 (cURL - Wikipedia). Given the contemporary timelines, an early version like curl 5.0, available from archived pages (Wayback Machine - Curl 5.0), is a suitable candidate for porting to OpenStep 4.2.
Dependencies and Porting Requirements
Curl is written in C, and OpenStep 4.2 uses GCC 2.7.2.1 as its compiler, as noted in user forums (Want to buy objective-c Openstep 4.2). This compatibility suggests that compiling C-based tools is feasible. However, curl 5.0 includes HTTPS support, which relies on SSLeay, an SSL implementation from the mid-90s by Eric Young (SSLeay - Wikipedia). SSLeay, also written in C, needs to be ported to OpenStep, requiring the source code and configuration for the target system.
SSLeay's availability is supported by historical documentation, such as its use in Samba distributions (Oreilly), indicating it was widely distributed in the 90s. Given OpenStep's Unix base, standard libraries like BSD sockets, necessary for Curl's networking, should be present, reducing additional dependency issues.
Compilation and Optimization
To compile SSLeay:
Download the source code, likely from FTP archives or the Internet Archive, given its age.

Configure using the provided script, adjusting for OpenStep's environment, such as specifying the installation path and compiler flags.

Compile with GCC 2.7.2.1, ensuring optimization for size (-Os) and performance, given the limited RAM (32MB to 128MB).

For Curl:
Download curl 5.0, as seen in the archived page, which lists new features like HTTP file upload and HTTPS support (Wayback Machine - Curl 5.0).

Configure, linking against the compiled SSLeay, and compile with similar optimizations.

Install the binaries in a system path accessible to users, ensuring compatibility with OpenStep's file system.

Given the architectures (680x0, SPARC, x86), compilation may need to be performed on each platform or via cross-compilation, depending on available tools. For emulators like Previous, which emulate NeXT hardware, the 680x0 target is relevant.
Resource Constraints and Testing
The limited resources (68040 CPU, 32MB to 128MB RAM) require careful optimization. Curl is known for its lightweight nature, with early versions like 5.0 having minimal memory footprint, as noted in historical discussions (My first 25 years of HTTP | daniel.haxx.se). SSLeay, being a cryptographic library, may consume more memory, but basic operations should fit within the constraints.
Testing on vintage hardware or emulators is crucial. The task mentions running on Previous and actual machines, so verifying functionality, especially for HTTP and HTTPS requests, ensures compatibility. Given the lack of direct access, the assumption is that successful compilation and linking imply functionality, based on Curl's historical portability (cURL - Wikipedia).
Code Structure and Integration
The task requests examples of proper code structure in NeXTStep and OpenStep. Since Curl is a C program, not Objective-C, direct examples are limited. However, OpenStep's Unix base means standard C practices apply, such as using Makefiles and configure scripts, as seen in curl 5.0's features (Wayback Machine - Curl 5.0). Integration involves ensuring Curl uses system libraries correctly, such as linking against OpenStep's C library and SSLeay, without needing Objective-C wrappers for the command-line tool.
Detailed Files and Dependencies
The necessary files include:
SSLeay source code (e.g., C files, configure script, Makefile).

Curl source code (e.g., main.c, http.c, ftp.c, configure script, Makefile).

Compiled libraries (libssleay.a, libcurl.a, if needed).

Build scripts or modified Makefiles for OpenStep compatibility.

Dependencies beyond SSLeay, such as standard C libraries, are likely pre-installed on OpenStep, given its Unix foundation. The task's emphasis on dependencies suggests ensuring SSLeay is ported, which aligns with the HTTPS support in curl 5.0.
Conclusion
Implementing Curl on OpenStep 4.2 is feasible by compiling curl 5.0 and porting SSLeay, using OpenStep's GCC 2.7.2.1. Optimization for limited resources and testing on target systems ensure functionality, addressing the task's requirements for vintage computer compatibility.
